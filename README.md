# CHATBOT-FOR-AGRICULTURAL-PRICING



ABSTRACT
In the core of rural farm societies, where farming is the cornerstone of economic survival, farmers usually suffer from difficulty in getting access to real-time, open market prices of their commodities. The conventional price discovery system is full of inefficiencies, and farmers end up relying on intermediaries that skew the flow of information and drain their margins. Such an absence of timely and accessible price information generates uncertainty, economic loss, and the opportunity to reap greater revenues. Our solution to this issue presents an AI-Powered Agriculture Pricing Chatbot—a technology intended to make price intelligence for farmers widely accessible through providing real-time accurate, and actionable market intelligence using an accessible chat platform.
At its core, this chatbot combines machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to respond to queries from farmers in their language and return similar information on crop prices. By converting large datasets—comprising commodity prices, market trends, and history—into structured embeddings in a FAISS vector database, the system offers rapid and reliable access to market prices. The chatbot is embedded in Telegram, a widely used platform in rural areas, and thus is made accessible even in far-flung areas with poor internet connectivity. Besides simply offering current prices, the chatbot also predicts future trends, enabling farmers to plan strategically for their sales and avoid monetary losses resulting from market fluctuations.
This invention is a step towards financial independence and digital literacy, not only a technological one. Eliminating middlemen and giving direct access to real-time market data helps the chatbot promote informed decision-making, enabling farmers to maximise their profits and negotiate reasonable rates. Designed with inclusivity in mind, it supports several languages and voice-based interactions, ensuring that even people with limited literacy can benefit from its features. This project marks a future whereby farmers are active participants in a fair and transparent agricultural economy rather than at the mercy of erratic market forces by bridging the gap between conventional farming methods and modern digital tools.

EXISTING SYSTEM

The current agricultural pricing system is largely dependent on traditional market mechanisms, government portals, and intermediaries, which often create inefficiencies and delays. Farmers typically rely on sources like local traders, newspaper listings, and government-run portals such as Agmarknet, which provide periodic updates on market prices. However, these methods lack real-time accessibility, leading to outdated pricing information that may not reflect current market conditions. Additionally, many farmers in rural areas face challenges in accessing digital platforms, either due to limited internet connectivity, lack of digital literacy, or language barriers. This results in an overreliance on middlemen, who exploit the knowledge gap and manipulate prices, reducing farmers’ profit margins.

Moreover, existing mobile applications and websites designed for agricultural market insights often require users to navigate complex interfaces and manually search for pricing information, which can be a barrier for those unfamiliar with digital tools. Additionally, most current systems do not provide predictive insights—they only show historical or real-time prices, making it difficult for farmers to plan sales strategically. Without AI-driven forecasting models, farmers remain vulnerable to sudden market fluctuations, leading to financial instability and uninformed decision-making.

DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM

Delayed Updates: Information is often outdated by the time it reaches the farmers.
Middlemen Dependency: Farmers must negotiate through intermediaries, reducing profit margins.
Lack of Personalization: Existing systems do not offer tailored advice based on regional or crop-specific trends.
Limited Accessibility: Many platforms are not designed with low digital literacy in mind.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
The AI-powered Agriculture Pricing Chatbot aims to eliminate these inefficiencies by offering a real-time, AI-driven pricing system that delivers instant market insights, predictive analytics, and personalized recommendations. Unlike the existing systems that rely on static data updates, this chatbot integrates machine learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models to process real-time data, extract relevant insights, and forecast price trends. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP), the chatbot can understand farmer queries in multiple languages, including voice-based inputs, making it highly accessible even for those with limited literacy.
Additionally, the chatbot is integrated with Telegram, a widely used messaging platform that ensures accessibility even in low-bandwidth regions. Farmers can simply send a text or voice message to the chatbot to receive instant responses on current crop prices, market trends, and future price predictions. The system stores structured data using FAISS vector search, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of price details based on location, commodity, and historical patterns. By removing middlemen, reducing price uncertainty, and offering AI-powered recommendations, this chatbot not only improves market transparency but also empowers farmers with the data they need to make informed, strategic selling decisions—leading to greater financial stability and economic empowerment.

ALGORITHMS

Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Chatbot Optimization

To facilitate intelligent user interactions, the chatbot integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. Tokenization and Named Entity Recognition (NER) extract key details such as crop names, locations, and dates from farmer queries. Intent Classification (using Naïve Bayes, SVM, and BERT) ensures that the chatbot accurately understands user requests, whether related to pricing, weather, or farming advice. Response Generation models (Seq2Seq and Transformers) help the chatbot provide context-aware replies. Additionally, K-Means Clustering and Decision Tree Classification segment users based on farming patterns, ensuring personalized market insights. The chatbot continuously improves using Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning), which refines its responses based on user feedback. This combination of ML, NLP, and reinforcement learning ensures an efficient, adaptive, and user-friendly AI chatbot for agricultural pricing.


Vector Search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Accurate Responses

The chatbot employs FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for high-speed vector retrieval, ensuring efficient and relevant data retrieval. When a farmer enters a query (e.g., "What is the current price of wheat in Punjab?"), the chatbot vectorizes the query using an embedding model (such as Sentence Transformers) and searches the FAISS vector store to retrieve the most relevant price records. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) further enhances chatbot performance by combining vector-based search with generative AI models (such as GPT-4 or BERT). This approach improves accuracy by ensuring that responses are generated based on real-time and verified agricultural data, minimizing errors and hallucinations in chatbot outputs.

SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

MODULE 1: DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING
Data collection is the foundation of the AI-powered Agriculture Pricing Chatbot, ensuring that farmers receive real-time and accurate crop pricing information. The dataset is sourced from government agricultural portals (such as Agmarknet), market APIs, and research databases that provide structured information on crop varieties, state-wise market prices, seasonal trends, and supply-demand fluctuations. This raw data is often noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent, requiring a robust preprocessing pipeline to make it suitable for machine learning models. The preprocessing phase begins with data cleaning, where missing values are handled using imputation techniques or discarded if they lack critical information. Normalization techniques are applied to standardize price values, currency formats, and measurement units to ensure consistency across different sources. Feature extraction plays a crucial role in enhancing model performance—this involves identifying important attributes like region, crop type, market conditions, and historical price trends, which can be used for training machine learning models. Additionally, vectorization methods (such as TF-IDF and word embeddings) convert textual data into a numerical format suitable for processing by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models. This structured, cleaned, and optimized dataset is then stored in a FAISS vector database, enabling fast and accurate information retrieval for chatbot queries.



MODULE 2: Model Training and RAG Chain Setup
The second module focuses on training machine learning models using the preprocessed agricultural pricing data and setting up a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for improved chatbot responses. The model training process involves feeding historical market prices, demand-supply trends, and external factors such as weather conditions and government policies into deep learning models (such as LSTMs and ARIMA for time-series forecasting). These models are trained to predict future price trends, helping farmers make informed selling decisions.
The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model is designed to combine vector-based search with generative AI, ensuring that the chatbot retrieves the most relevant agricultural pricing information 

while maintaining contextual coherence. The RAG model is built using FAISS for vector search, allowing the chatbot to retrieve the best-matching crop price records within milliseconds. The retriever component searches for the most relevant data, while the generator component formulates a natural-sounding response using pre-trained language models like GPT-4 or BERT. The final trained model is saved and optimized for fast inference, ensuring that farmers receive quick and precise responses when querying the chatbot.



 MODULE 3: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)                                 FOR CHATBOT

The third module is responsible for natural language processing (NLP) and user interaction, allowing the chatbot to understand farmer queries in multiple languages and formats. Farmers often phrase their questions differently—for example, "What is the price of rice in Tamil Nadu?" vs. "How much is paddy selling for in Chennai?". To handle such variations, the NLP module uses text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal to extract the core intent of the user query.
A crucial aspect of this module is named entity recognition (NER), which identifies commodities (e.g., wheat, maize), locations (e.g., Maharashtra, Punjab), and pricing intent (e.g., min price, max price, modal price) within the query. This enables the chatbot to convert user input into a structured format that can be processed by the FAISS vector store and the RAG model. Additionally, intent classification models (trained using supervised learning) categorize queries into different types, such as price inquiry, market trends, and selling recommendations.
Furthermore, multilingual support ensures accessibility for farmers from different regions, allowing them to interact in their native language. Voice-based queries are also processed using speech-to-text models (such as Google ASR or Whisper AI), making the chatbot even more user-friendly. These NLP techniques collectively enhance query understanding, response accuracy, and overall chatbot effectiveness.

MODULE 4: Telegram Bot Integration and Deployment

The final module involves integrating the trained RAG model and NLP system with Telegram to create a fully functional AI chatbot for farmers. Telegram was chosen due to its wide adoption in rural areas, lightweight infrastructure, and ability to handle queries even in low-bandwidth conditions. The chatbot is implemented using the Telegram Bot API, which facilitates seamless communication between the user and the backend AI system.
The integration process starts with setting up webhooks that allow the chatbot to receive messages in real time. Once a user submits a query, the message is processed by the NLP module, which extracts relevant entities and converts the query into a structured format. The FAISS vector store then retrieves the closest matching agricultural price records, while the RAG model generates a natural language response. The chatbot delivers the response via Telegram in an easy-to-understand format, displaying information such as commodity name, market location, minimum and maximum price, and future price trends.
For scalability and continuous availability, the chatbot is deployed using FastAPI or Flask on cloud platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud, or Railway.app. Additionally, an asynchronous event loop (using asyncio) ensures that the chatbot can handle multiple user queries simultaneously without delays. By integrating voice input, multi-language support, and real-time market insights, the chatbot serves as a reliable digital assistant for farmers, enabling them to make informed financial decisions and optimize their sales strategy.
